<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>FoxLottery is a fully decentralized lottery using crypto assets and smart contracts.
ERC20 tokens collected from users are distributed to random winners.
Staking a FoxLottery Token entitles you to a portion of the lottery proceeds and the right to vote on how the proceeds are used for charitable purposes.
Staking users&apos; votes determine how the money is used for charitable activities, and the money is transferred to the charity&apos;s wallet.</p>
<p>While a regular lottery ticket gives back about 50% of the proceeds.
Foxlottery will return 75% to users, 5% to affiliate users, the remaining 15% to revenue, and 5% to non-profit expenses.</p>
<p>Lottery proceeds will be used for the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Operated by DeFi</li>
<li>PR activities</li>
<li>Development funds</li>
<li>Building an ecosystem</li>
<li>Dividends to staking wallets</li>
</ul>
<p>Foxlottery&apos;s organization will work towards becoming a fully DAO (self-sustaining decentralized organization).</p>
<h1 id="vision">Vision</h1>
<p>Decentralized lotteries improve society</p>
<h1 id="challenges-of-centralized-lotteries">Challenges of centralized lotteries</h1>
<ul>
<li>Lack of transparency.</li>
<li>Low distribution rate.</li>
<li>A portion of profits are used for charity, but where to donate is centrally determined.</li>
<li>Large amount of money spent on sales promotion.</li>
<li>Paper raffles are not good for the environment.</li>
<li>When you win a prize, you have to go to the bank to pick it up.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="solutions-and-functions-to-solve-the-problems">Solutions and functions to solve the problems</h1>
<ul>
<li>Transparent determination of winners</li>
<li>High distribution rate</li>
<li>Affiliates reduce promotion costs</li>
<li>Vote on where to donate proceeds when purchasing lottery tickets</li>
<li>DAO-ization</li>
<li>Winnings are automatically transferred to your wallet when you win.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transparent-winner-determination">Transparent winner determination</h2>
<p>Since random numbers are generated on the blockchain, winners can be determined transparently.</p>
<h2 id="high-distribution-rate">High distribution rate</h2>
<p>Advantages of decentralized lotteries</p>
<ul>
<li>Low operating costs</li>
<li>Affiliate functionality keeps promotional costs low.</li>
<li>Winning money is high.</li>
<li>Charity expenses are high, and the recipients of the funds used are determined by voting.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="img/en/distributed_lottery_distribution_rates.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Disadvantages of a centralized lottery</p>
<ul>
<li>A high percentage of revenue is generated by headquarters.</li>
<li>Printed on paper, which is expensive to print and bad for the environment.</li>
<li>Social contribution PR expenses are low, and the recipients of the funds are centrally determined.</li>
<li>The amount of winning money is small.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of a Japanese lottery.</p>
<p><img src="img/en/centralized_lottery_distribution_rates.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="reduce-promotional-costs-with-affiliates">Reduce promotional costs with affiliates</h2>
<p>Affiliates can refer users to Foxlottery and receive a sales commission when users buy lottery tickets.</p>
<p>Affiliates need to staking Foxlottery&apos;s ERC20 tokens above a certain amount to participate.
5% of the amount of lottery tickets purchased is paid to the affiliate as an affiliate commission. If not through an affiliate, the funds are paid to the Foxlottery management.
Therefore, the lottery participant pays the same amount whether he/she participates through an affiliate or directly from the Foxlottery operation&apos;s website.</p>
<h2 id="vote-for-where-to-donate-the-proceeds-when-you-buy-your-lottery-ticket">Vote for where to donate the proceeds when you buy your lottery ticket</h2>
<p>When purchasing lottery tickets, users select the SDG goals they want to achieve
For each goal, select an organization that is active in that area.</p>
<p><img src="img/en/SDGs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After the lottery is over, a portion of the proceeds will be immediately remitted to the organization determined by the vote.
This speedy approach to philanthropy makes society more peaceful and prosperous.</p>
<p>Charitable organizations can apply to Foxlottery to have their profile and wallet address placed on the donation list.</p>
<h2 id="dao-ization">DAO-ization</h2>
<p>Governance token holders set the policy for the application.
The owner organization handles marketing activities and development.
Staking will receive a portion of the proceeds.</p>
<h2 id="when-you-win-the-money-is-automatically-transferred-to-your-wallet">When you win, the money is automatically transferred to your wallet.</h2>
<p>Japanese lottery tickets require a person to bring identification to a bank on a weekday at noon for a large lottery win.
With blockchain, the money is automatically transferred to your wallet when you win and can be used on the same day.</p>
<p>Some foreign lotteries are forfeited if you do not pick up your lottery ticket within 7 days of the winning date.
By having the money sent automatically, you will not forget to get it.</p>

<p>Set up a weekly lottery, with a slightly higher chance of winning if deposited in the lottery on the first day of the week. Allow more funds to be collected on the first day of the week.
The collected ERC20 tokens will be invested in uniswap or other means to generate income.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-use-the-lottery-participants">How to use the lottery participants</h1>
<p>You can purchase Foxlottery tokens on exchanges or DeFi and
There are daily, weekly, monthly, and annual lottery smart contracts, so you can deposit funds into whichever one you like.

On the day of the winner, a winner will be chosen at random and the money will be automatically transferred to the winner.
The money will be sent to the organization that will use the charitable activities as determined by the vote.</p>

<h3 id="japan">Japan</h3>
<p>The issuance of lottery tickets for sale by ordinary individuals or companies is prohibited under Article 187 of the Penal Code.
Lottery tickets can be sold by the national prefectures and 20 designated cities, i.e., local governments, as stipulated in the Lottery Law &quot;Lottery Prize Certificate Law&quot; (enacted in 1948). These local governments are authorized by the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications to act as ticket sellers and outsource ticket sales and other operations to banks and other financial institutions.</p>

<p>Although prohibited for religious reasons, there are some government-issued lotteries.
The Multi Millionaire lottery is sold at the Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports, where the winner receives $1 million and other prizes such as cars and motorcycles are given away.

<p>Lotteries are not regulated and issue licenses for online casinos.
You can start a lottery business without an online casino license, but a license gives you more credibility.
