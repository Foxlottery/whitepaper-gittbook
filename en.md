# Overview
FoxLottery is a blockchain lottery using crypto assets and smart contracts.

It is intended for use by municipalities that conduct lotteries around the world.

You can start a lottery immediately by setting the lottery return rate, the ERC20 tokens to be used as criteria, and the lottery cycle.

The ERC20 tokens collected from users will be distributed to random winners.

The winner is determined using Chainlink VRF, which generates random numbers on the blockchain.

# Vision.
### Decentralized lotteries improve society


# Benefits of decentralized lotteries
#### Guarantee of randomness of winners

Until now, the public has had to trust the government to trust the lottery winners to make random decisions about who wins the lottery.
Blockchain makes it easier for the public to participate in the lottery by trusting the system without having to trust the government.

#### Highly secure
The speed at which bugs are found is faster when you have an open source blockchain lottery, and it is harder to hack because of the blockchain.

#### Traceability of funds
You can see how much you have transferred to which address.

#### Open source
By making it open source, governments around the world can use the same lottery system worldwide without having to develop their own online lottery systems. If there is a need for a feature, some country adds it and it is shared with the rest of the world so that if they want to use that feature, it is immediately available.

# use cases

User pays to lottery

Legal restrictions: Lotteries are not legally allowed by private companies in all countries

Barriers to entry: Lack of examples of blockchain-based lotteries makes it difficult to implement.

- world wide lottery
- Government lotteries
- credit card pay to lottery

### world wide lottery

A lottery that has no national borders and is open to people from all over the world.
The profits from lotteries are used to generate tax revenue for each country.
For example, 50% of the ticket price of a lottery ticket purchased by an American is remitted as taxes in the U.S., and the remaining 50% is used as the lottery prize.
Since money is collected from all over the world to play the lottery, the winnings are higher, the number of participants increases, and the tax revenues of each country increase.

### Government Lotteries

The government issues the tickets, the public buys the tickets, and the government keeps the tax revenue.

**Issues**.

Lack of transparency.
In countries without credit, lotteries are not possible.

### credit card pay to lottery

Lottery management issues credit cards and distributes them to users, who then make purchases as they would with a regular card.
When a user makes a purchase, the company managing the card network (visa, master) pays 1.75% of the amount spent to the card issuer as a commission.

The profits made from this fee are distributed as a lottery with a portion of the proceeds going to the lottery.

Card issuers use a point system to attract members.

A VISA card issuer is called an ISSUEUR.

In this lottery, users can participate in the lottery without loss.

Just by changing your everyday card to a lottery credit card, the path to becoming a millionaire is open to everyone.

**Issues**.

I would rather spend a lot of money if I win the lottery than spend a small amount of points using a credit card.

- something trigger lottery
- Organizational lotteries

### something trigger lottery

Twitter retweets, volunteer work, event participation, etc.

Developers are free to develop what triggers the distribution of lottery tickets.

**Issues**.

It is a small project, and it is not possible to give a big incentive to participants to do something.

We see many twitter retweet projects, etc., but we don't know if many of them are really distributing gifts or money, or if they are randomly selecting winners.

### Organizational Lottery

Distribute lottery tickets to people who have done good work in a company, etc., and remit a portion of the profits to the winners at the end of the month or at the end of the year
Can create an incentive to work within the organization.

**Alternative Ex**.

Stock options, bonuses, incentives per deal

**Issue**.

Stock option incentives take several years to list and it takes time for the incentives to be reflected.
If we try to increase incentives to salespeople for each deal won, we will not be able to encourage cooperation within the organization.


# Roadmap
July 2022 Launch on testnet

Aug. 2022 Propose lottery smart contract to EIP, Start experimenting with retweet project on twitter

Sep. 2022 Propose introduction to governments and municipalities

2024 If multiple governments and municipalities introduce it, establish a world wide lottery foundation and jointly conduct a lottery

# History of lotteries
The oldest lottery in history is said to be the "White Pigeon Ballot" conducted in 206 B.C. in China during the Han Dynasty by a man named Zhang Liang, who served as Liu Bang's military commander. The reason for implementing this lottery was to secure financial resources to build the Great Wall of China.

In Europe, during the Roman Empire, churches played lotteries to raise funds for construction.

In Japan, temples used lotteries to raise funds during the Edo period.

However, because there were many cases in Japan and the U.S. where the operating bodies of lotteries were often found to be corrupt, leading to riots, lotteries were banned by law around 1900, and the government became the operating body and started playing lotteries to secure tax revenues.

# Why are lotteries prohibited by law?
This is because private sector lotteries are subject to fraud.

With blockchain technology, no cheating can occur, so in the long run, I believe that lotteries will move in the direction where private companies can use blockchain to conduct lotteries.


# Examples of Lottery Fraud
Serbia's state-run lottery company cheated

# web3 Lottery participant usage
Obtain an ERC20 token from an exchange or DeFi.

Access the lottery website, log in with a wallet service such as metamask, and purchase a ticket.

Once you have purchased your ticket, you will be shown how likely it is that you will win the lottery.

On the day of the lottery, a winner will be chosen at random and the money will be automatically transferred to the winner.

The money will be sent to the organization that will use the money to support the charitable activities determined by the votes.
